Companion webpage to the book "Deep Learning for Computational Imaging".

The book will be published by Oxford University Press in 2024 or early 2025. 

Here is the [pdf of a draft of the book](/assets/deep_inverse_reader.pdf), copyright 2024 by Reinhard Heckel.

If you find any errors, typos, or if parts are unclear, or if you have any other feedback, please report them as an [issue here](https://github.com/MLI-lab/deep_inverse_book.github.io/issues), along with version of the draft where you found the issue.

Here are jupyter notebooks to reproduce some of the figures. You can run the notebooks on **Google Colab**.
