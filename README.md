Companion webpage to the book "Deep Learning for Computational Imaging".

The book will be published by Oxford University Press early 2025. 

Here is the [pdf of the book draft](/assets/deep_inverse_reader.pdf), copyright 2024 by Reinhard Heckel.

If you find any errors, typos, or if parts are unclear, or if you have any other feedback, please report them as an [issue here](https://github.com/MLI-lab/deep_inverse_book.github.io/issues), along with version of the draft where you found the issue, or write me an email.

Here are jupyter notebooks to reproduce some of the figures. You can run the notebooks on **Google Colab**.
